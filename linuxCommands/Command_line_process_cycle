#COMMAND-LINE-PROCESS-CYCLE
----------------------------
# The default order for command lookup is functions, followed by built-ins, with scripts and executables last. 
# There are three built-ins that you can use to override this order: `command`, `builtin` and `enable`. 

1)command  :#removes alias and function lookup. Only built-ins and commands found in the search path are executed.

2)builtin  : #looks up only built-in commands, ignoring functions and commands found in pATH

3)enable  : #enables and disables shell built-ins

4)eval :#takes arguments and run them through the command-line processing step all over again.
